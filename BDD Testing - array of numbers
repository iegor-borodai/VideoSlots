Story: Array of numbers

As a product owner
In order to verify the set of numbers
I want to find out if the numbers can be divided by 4,6 and find out how many there are

Scenario 1: Positive functional check
Given the array contains at least 4 values: one number that can be divided by 4, by 6, by 12 and one that cannot be divided by 4 and 6 (ex: 8.0, -6, 24, 7)
And these numbers in array are given for the input
When the function processed the array
Then the function reply the number of elements whick meets the devision criteria

(there should be 3 as the result)

Scenario 2: Negative functional check
Given the array contains at least 6 values: one number which is not integer (higher), one is zero, one is missed, one is a letter, 
one is a special symbol, one is a fractional number (ex:  2147483648, -45, 0, , a, @, 0.26)
And these numbers in array are given for the input
When the function processed the array
Then the function reply with the error
And the exceptions are shown
