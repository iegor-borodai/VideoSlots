Story: palindrome string

As a product owner
In order to validate the word to be the palindrome
I want to check the word

Scenario 1: Positive functional check
Given the word which is palindrome (ex: civic)
And this word is given for the input
When the function processed the word
Then the function reply it is palindrome

Scenario 3: Negative functional check
Given the word which is NOT palindrome (ex: abcd)
And this word is given for the input
When the function processed the word
Then the function reply it is NOT a palindrome

Scenario 3: Negative special functional check
Given the string which is NOT palindrome (ex: 1234; @#$%; фыва)
And this word is given for the input
When the function processed the word
Then the function reply it is NOT a palindrome and show the exception
